# OSPF Info

## Attributes
- Updates are sent using multicast
  - 224.0.0.5 All OSPF routers(DR other)
  - 224.0.0.6 All OSPF Designated Routers
- Updates are sent in the form os Link State Advertisements(LSA)
  - LSA Type 1 - Router LSA
    - Sent between routers in the same area. Type 1 LSAs are used to describe its own interfaces and transmitts data about other adjacent routers.
  - LSA Type 2 - Network LSA
    - Generated by the DR to describe all the routers connected to it segment directly. Flooded between neighbors in the same area and remains within the area
  - LSA Type 3 - OSPF Summary LSA
    - Generated by the ABR to summarize it's directly connected area and advertise inter-area routes for the areas that the ABR is connected to. Type 3 LSA packets are flooded into every interconnecte area.
  - LSA Type 4 - OSPF ASBR Summary LSA
    - Advertises the presence of an Autonmous System Border Router to other areas in the network via the ABR.
  - LSA Type 5 - OSPF ASBR External LSA
    - ASBR uses Type 5 LSAs to advertise external redistributed routes. The ASBR advertises the routes as either extern type 1 or 2 routes.
      - External Type 1 metric - this is equal to the link-state metric, where the total is equal to the sum of the interal costs and the external cost.
     - External Type 2 metric - greater than the cost of the path interal to the AS. Type 2 external metrics use only the external cost to the destination and ignores the cost to reach the ABR.
  - LSA Type 7 - Not So Stubby Area external LSA
    - Used in special areas where Type 5 External LSAs are not allowed.  The Type 5 LSA is converted into a Type 7 LSA to get around these restrictions. This Type 7 LSA allows external advertisements to move through the special area to reach the ABR that can convert them back to a Type 5.   
  - LSA Type 8 - Link Local LSA(OSPFv3)
    - Used to carry IPv6 information through areas. Only flooded on the local link.
  - LSA Type 9 - Intra-Area LSA
    - Is only flooded through a single area. Used for router-LSA, Network-LSA, inter-area-prefix-LSA, inter-area-router-LSA and intra-area-prefix-LSA.
